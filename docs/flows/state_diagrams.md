# End-to-End Messaging Flows

This guide illustrates the canonical lifecycle that macOS client engineers should
implement when interacting with Swifty Server. Each section includes a Mermaid
state diagram followed by notes highlighting error handling expectations and
compatibility considerations.

## 1. Registration

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unregistered
    Unregistered --> Registering: POST /register
    Registering --> Registered: 200 OK + JWT
    Registering --> RegistrationFailed: 4xx/5xx
    RegistrationFailed --> Registering: retry with backoff
    Registered --> [*]
```

- **Happy path:** Send the `ClientRegistrationRequest` payload to `/register`
  and persist the returned JWT for the lifetime of the session.
- **Compatibility:** New optional fields may appear in the response; ignore
  unknown keys to remain forward compatible.
- **Errors:** On HTTP 4xx/5xx parse the `ErrorResponse` body. Retry non-4xx
  failures with exponential backoff and jitter.

## 2. Topic subscription lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Disconnected
    Disconnected --> Connecting: ws://.../ws?token
    Connecting --> Connected: connection frame
    Connecting --> AuthenticationError: close code 1008
    AuthenticationError --> Disconnected
    Connected --> Subscribing: POST /topics/subscribe
    Subscribing --> Subscribed: 200 OK
    Subscribing --> SubscriptionError: 4xx/5xx
    SubscriptionError --> Subscribing: retry/backoff
    Subscribed --> Listening
    Listening --> Disconnected: network drop -> reconnect handler
```

- **Handshake:** Wait for the `connection` frame before issuing subscription
  commands. If the server sends an `error` frame referencing authentication,
  drop the socket and request a fresh JWT.
- **Reconnection:** On disconnect, resume at the `Connecting` state. Reuse the
  same JWT if it is still within TTL; otherwise re-register.

## 3. Publish â†’ Acknowledge sequence

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ReadyToPublish
    ReadyToPublish --> Publishing: enqueue OutboundFrame.topic/direct
    Publishing --> AwaitingReceipt: send loop transmits JSON frame
    AwaitingReceipt --> ReceiptReceived: server emits `sent`/`topic_sent`
    AwaitingReceipt --> ErrorFrame: server emits `error`
    ErrorFrame --> ReadyToPublish: inspect `detail`, mutate payload, retry
    ReceiptReceived --> AwaitingAck: message required acknowledge == true
    AwaitingAck --> Acked: peer sends `ack`
    AwaitingAck --> AckTimeout: timeout expires
    AckTimeout --> ReadyToPublish: surface error to UI/backoff
    Acked --> ReadyToPublish
```

- **Backpressure:** Calls to `send(_:)` suspend when the outbound queue reaches
  capacity. Use `Task` priorities to prevent UI lockups.
- **Delivery receipts:** The client transitions to `ReceiptReceived` when a
  `sent` or `topic_sent` frame is decoded. Attach tracing metadata (such as the
  `msgid`) to correlate UI status indicators.
- **Acknowledgments:** When `acknowledge` is true, maintain a timer that
  resolves once an `ack` frame referencing the same `msgid` arrives. The sample
  Swift client exposes a `PassthroughSubject` so the app can observe these
  events.

## 4. Error propagation

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Operational
    Operational --> RecoverableError: inbound `error`
    RecoverableError --> Operational: adjust payload/token and retry
    Operational --> MaintenanceNotice: inbound `status.updated`
    MaintenanceNotice --> Operational: switch based on `affected`
```

- **Recoverable errors:** Use the `detail` map when present to highlight input
  validation issues. If the frame includes a `msgid`, map it to the pending
  message to avoid duplicate retries.
- **Maintenance notices:** When a `status.updated` frame arrives, consult the
  included version strings to decide whether to re-register or renegotiate
  topic subscriptions.
